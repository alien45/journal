# 📓 Toufiq's Journal

Welcome to my digital journal — a personal space where I occasionally publish technical writeups, investigations, experiments, opinions, reflections, and whatever else is on my mind.

This isn't a blog in the traditional sense. It's more like a public diary: some posts are detailed case studies, others are raw technical breakdowns, how-tos, or observations from development, freelance gigs, open source work, or job-hunting experiences. Some posts may be longform; others may just be snippets or reminders to my future self.

You're welcome to read, explore, or use anything here — just know that I write this mostly for myself and anyone else who might benefit from the journey.
